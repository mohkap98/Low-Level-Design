# 🅿️ Parking Lot System – Low-Level Design (LLD)

This project is a clean and extensible **Low-Level Design (LLD)** of a multi-floor parking lot system, built in Python using core OOP principles and key software design patterns.

---

## ✅ Requirements

The system supports:

- Multiple **types of parking slots** (Car, Bike, Truck)
- Multiple **floors**, each having their own set of slots
- **Dynamic allocation** of slots based on vehicle type
- **Payment processing** via multiple methods (UPI, Credit Card, Bank)
- **Fare strategy** based on vehicle type and time parked
- Ticketless flow with clear entry and exit behavior

---

## 🏗️ System Structure

### 🚙 Vehicle Management
- Supports `Car`, `Bike`, `Truck`
- Created via a **Factory Pattern**
- Fare calculated using **Strategy Pattern**

### 🅿️ Parking Structure
- `ParkingLot`: Manages multiple floors
- `ParkingFloor`: Manages multiple slots
- `ParkingSlot`: Holds vehicle + availability info

### 💳 Payment System
- `PaymentStrategy`: Abstract strategy interface
- Concrete strategies: `UPI`, `CreditCard`, `BankACC`

### 💰 Fare Calculation
- `FareStrategy`: Abstract strategy interface
- `BasicFare` (for Car/Bike)
- `PremiumFare` (for Truck)

---

## 📦 Class Design

### 1. `Vehicle` (Abstract Base Class)
- Subclasses: `Car`, `Bike`, `Truck`
- Contains license plate and fare strategy

### 2. `VehicleFactory`
- Creates appropriate vehicle instances using a map

### 3. `ParkingSlot`
- Holds one vehicle at a time
- Knows if it's available or occupied

### 4. `ParkingFloor`
- Contains multiple slots of different types
- Can add slots and find available ones

### 5. `ParkingLot`
- Manages multiple floors
- Coordinates slot assignment and exit payment

### 6. `FareStrategy` Interface
- `BasicFare`: For Car and Bike (1, 6, 12 hour brackets)
- `PremiumFare`: For Truck (1, 6, 12 hour brackets)

### 7. `PaymentStrategy` Interface
- `UPI`, `CreditCard`, `BankACC`

## 🔁 Design Patterns Used

| Pattern            | Purpose                                                       |
|--------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| Factory Pattern     | To create `Vehicle` instances based on type                  |
| Strategy Pattern    | To handle both fare and payment method logic dynamically     |
| Composition         | `ParkingLot` → `ParkingFloor` → `ParkingSlot`                |
| Single Responsibility | Each class has one clear, maintainable job                 |
