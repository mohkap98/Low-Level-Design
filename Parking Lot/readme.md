# üÖøÔ∏è Parking Lot System ‚Äì Low-Level Design (LLD)

This project is a clean and extensible **Low-Level Design (LLD)** of a multi-floor parking lot system, built in Python using core OOP principles and key software design patterns.

---
## ‚úÖ Requirements

The system supports:

- Multiple **types of parking slots** (Car, Bike, Truck)
- Multiple **floors**, each having their own set of slots
- **Dynamic allocation** of slots based on vehicle type
- **Payment processing** via multiple methods (UPI, Credit Card, Bank)
- **Fare strategy** based on vehicle type and time parked
- Ticketless flow with clear entry and exit behavior

---

## üèóÔ∏è System Structure

### üöô Vehicle Management
- Supports `Car`, `Bike`, `Truck`
- Created via a **Factory Pattern**
- Fare calculated using **Strategy Pattern**

### üÖøÔ∏è Parking Structure
- `ParkingLot`: Manages multiple floors
- `ParkingFloor`: Manages multiple slots
- `ParkingSlot`: Holds vehicle + availability info

### üí≥ Payment System
- `PaymentStrategy`: Abstract strategy interface
- Concrete strategies: `UPI`, `CreditCard`, `BankACC`

### üí∞ Fare Calculation
- `FareStrategy`: Abstract strategy interface
- `BasicFare` (for Car/Bike)
- `PremiumFare` (for Truck)

---

## üì¶ Class Design

### 1. `Vehicle` (Abstract Base Class)
- Subclasses: `Car`, `Bike`, `Truck`
- Contains license plate and fare strategy

### 2. `VehicleFactory`
- Creates appropriate vehicle instances using a map

### 3. `ParkingSlot`
- Holds one vehicle at a time
- Knows if it's available or occupied

### 4. `ParkingFloor`
- Contains multiple slots of different types
- Can add slots and find available ones

### 5. `ParkingLot`
- Manages multiple floors
- Coordinates slot assignment and exit payment

### 6. `FareStrategy` Interface
- `BasicFare`: For Car and Bike (1, 6, 12 hour brackets)
- `PremiumFare`: For Truck (1, 6, 12 hour brackets)

### 7. `PaymentStrategy` Interface
- `UPI`, `CreditCard`, `BankACC`

## üîÅ Design Patterns Used

| Pattern            | Purpose                                                       |
|--------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| Factory Pattern     | To create `Vehicle` instances based on type                  |
| Strategy Pattern    | To handle both fare and payment method logic dynamically     |
| Composition         | `ParkingLot` ‚Üí `ParkingFloor` ‚Üí `ParkingSlot`                |
| Single Responsibility | Each class has one clear, maintainable job                 |

## üì¶ Core Functional Flows

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Vehicle Entry Flow

**Objective:** Allocate an available parking slot to a vehicle and issue a ticket.

**Steps:**
1. Vehicle object is created (`Car`, `Bike`, etc.)
2. `ParkingLot.assign_spot(vehicle)` is called.
3. System checks each floor and slot:
   - Finds the first available slot matching vehicle type.
4. Allocates the spot and generates a `Ticket`.
5. Returns ticket to user.

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Vehicle Exit Flow

**Objective:** Free the slot and calculate fee based on parked time.

**Steps:**
1. User provides the `Ticket` at exit.
2. `ParkingLot.release_spot(ticketId)` is triggered.
3. System:
   - Retrieves the ticket
   - Calculates duration using `FeeStrategy`
   - Frees the slot
   - Processes payment using `PaymentStrategy`
   - Returns receipt to user

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Find Available Slot Flow

**Objective:** Return available slots by vehicle type.

**Steps:**
1. User queries: `ParkingLot.get_available_slots(vehicle_type)`
2. System loops through all floors and slots.
3. Filters available slots matching the type.
4. Returns list of available `ParkingSpot`s
