# ðŸ§  Command Pattern with Undo â€“ Python Text Editor Example

---

## ðŸ“˜ Overview

The **Command Pattern** is a behavioral design pattern that turns a request into a standalone object containing all the information needed to perform the action later.  
This pattern:

- Decouples the object that **invokes** a command from the one that **executes** it.
- Enables support for **undo**, **redo**, **queueing**, and **macro operations**.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Problem It Solves

In many systems (like text editors), you want to:

- Issue commands without tightly coupling them to how the action is performed
- Track a history of operations
- Implement **undo/redo functionality**
- Support multiple types of commands dynamically

    class BoldCommand {
        -previous_state: str
        +execute(doc: Document)
        +undo(doc: Document)
    }

    class UndoCommand {
        +execute(doc: Document)
    }

    class Document {
        -content: str
        -history: List~Command~
        +show(): void
    }

    Command <|-- TypeCommand
    Command <|-- BoldCommand
    Command <|-- UndoCommand

    TypeCommand ..> Document : uses
    BoldCommand ..> Document : uses
    UndoCommand ..> Document : uses
