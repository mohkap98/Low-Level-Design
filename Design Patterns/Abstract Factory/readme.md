# ðŸš˜ Abstract Factory Design Pattern â€“ Car Dealership Example

---

## ðŸ“˜ Overview

The **Abstract Factory Pattern** is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating **families of related or dependent objects** without specifying their concrete classes.

This pattern is useful when the system needs to be **independent of how its objects are created**, composed, and represented.

## ðŸ’¡ Real-World Analogy: Car Dealership

A car dealership can sell vehicles from **multiple brands**. Each brand offers a **Car** and a **Bike**. Instead of hardcoding brand logic, we use factories to abstract the creation process.

| Brand    | Car         | Bike         |
|----------|-------------|--------------|
| BMW      | BMWCar      | BMWBike      |
| Maruti   | MarutiCar   | MarutiBike   |

Using **Abstract Factory**, we ensure that:
- Clients (like the dealership) don't need to know the brand-specific classes.
- We can switch the whole family of products easily (e.g., from BMW to Maruti).
